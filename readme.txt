This program is a **FastAPI**-based application designed to handle file uploads, processing, and providing results in the form of JSON responses. Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:

### Purpose:

The primary goal of this application is to allow users to upload files (specifically images or documents), process them using custom logic, and return results as JSON or some other format. The processing logic seems to be related to electricity bills (as suggested by the `/ElecBills` endpoint), but the specifics of the processing function (`main`, `apiMain`) are not provided. 

### Key Features:

1. **File Upload (`/upload` and `/ElecBills`)**:
   - Users can upload one or multiple files via the `/upload` and `/ElecBills` endpoints.
   - The uploaded files are saved in the `static/inputs` directory.
   - For the `/ElecBills` endpoint, each file is given a unique timestamp-based filename, and the contents are processed by the `apiMain` function (presumably related to extracting data from the electricity bill image).

2. **File Processing (`/extract`)**:
   - The `/extract` endpoint triggers a function (`main`) that processes all files in the `static/inputs` directory.
   - The results are saved into an output dictionary and can be retrieved later via other endpoints.

3. **Results Retrieval (`/result/{filename}`)**:
   - After processing, users can retrieve the result of a specific file by calling `/result/{filename}`, which returns the stored JSON result.

4. **Clear Directory (`clear_contents`)**:
   - This function is used to delete files from the `static/inputs` directory to keep it clean between runs or after file processing.

5. **Static Files**:
   - The application serves static files (e.g., input and output files) via the `/static` route.

6. **Main Processing Functions**:
   - The core processing of the files is handled by the `main` and `apiMain` functions (imported from `main.py`), though these functions are not detailed here. These functions likely handle extracting information from the uploaded files, possibly related to data extraction from bills or documents.

### Directory Structure:
- `static/inputs`: Stores the uploaded files.
- `static/results`: Stores the processed results.
- `static/failed`: Stores any files that failed to process.

### Flow:
1. Users upload files via `/upload` or `/ElecBills`.
2. The uploaded files are saved in `static/inputs`.
3. Files are processed using `main` or `apiMain`, generating results.
4. The results can be retrieved via `/result/{filename}`.

### Usage Example:
- A user uploads an electricity bill image via `/ElecBills`.
- The app processes the bill and returns extracted data (e.g., billing information) in JSON format.
- The user can retrieve the result via `/result/{filename}`.
